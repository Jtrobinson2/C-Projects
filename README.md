# C Projects
- From Wordle to a Binary Encoder and Decoder these are some of the projects I have created while learning 
the C programming language 



##  :beginner: About
Each project is in a different folder as follows:
- /P2: Base10 and Base 25 Calculator
- /P3: Wordle Clone
- /P4: Employee Database Manager
- /P5: Binary encoder and decoder
- /P6: Hashmap implementation

## :zap: Usage
Each project must be linekd and compiled on the command line using c99. All headers and source files that need 
to be linked will be located in the same directory as the project directory

Projects were originally compiled in GCC. 


## :star2: Credit/Acknowledgment
Dr. David Sturgil created the bash test's and project requirements as well 
as starter code for project 6.
